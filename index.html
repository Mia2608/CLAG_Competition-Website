<p> Social media has become a popular source of communication and gossip these days.
  Today's generation focuses more on the gossip and the feed they get off social media.
  As of the late 90s, there was a social media app which was created that was called "Six Degrees" which was created in 1997.
  This app was created for people to create profiles and make new friends with different users.
  The next app which was created was LinkedIn which was created in 2002.
  Facebook was then created in 2004 for people to share their information with family, friends and the world around them.
  Youtube was created in 2005 for people to share videos or their lives or for entertainment. Many people made this app go viral within 2005 and today.
  As time went on, more apps such as Twitter, Skype, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, Tumblr and many other apps were created.
  This affected the way in which people use dto communicate before.
 And as a generation today we don't leave the house unless needed. We communicate via these social media apps.
 Not just for communication, but teenagers use social media to share different types of gossip to the world.
 We use social media for various reasons; to share personal information, to communicate with family and friends, to meet new people internationally and so on. </p>


 <p> Besides social media being out there, it has affected teenagers in many ways.
 Teenagers don't focus in class as they are always on their phones scrolling through social media.
 Sitting with family, teenagers are on social media and don't communicate with their family
 Social media has also lead to an effect of laziness.
 All we tend to do as a society today is spend 95% of our time on social media and barely communicate with the outisde world.
 We communicate through video calling, voice calling, texting and sharing memes.
 The effect on teenagers has become a serious issue. Psychologists and oarents find that it is hard to get teenagers off their phones and social media.
Teenagers lack education as well due to socila media. They spend more time on social media than doing homework or studying.
Social media causes a whole lot of mental disorders as well due to peer pressure and what teens see on social media. </p>
